                    <p>The game was made as part of the 2024 Three Thing Game jam, which can be found <a href = "https://itch.io/jam/three-thing-game-october-2024">here</a>.</p>
                    <p>The three 'things' that this game was designed around were:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Spell,</li>
                        <li>Banker,</li>
                        <li>Cripping Debt.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The game probably has plenty of bugs that I haven't encountered yet (or haven't had time to fix), as the jam took place across the course of three days and there was only one of me working on the game.</p>
